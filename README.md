# Ultra
Become ultimate in all your desired talents, with habit science designed game Ultra.

## What is Ultra?
Ultra times how long you practice a talent, allowing you to earn ultra. 1 ultra is the equivalent of 7 consecutive days of 30 minutes practice, or 40 hours of total consistent progress. Both will progress towards an ultra, so you can put in as much effort as you want and be rewarded for it. 1 ultra represents 1 step of major improvement in a talent. If you don't keep up at minimum 30 minutes of practice, every other day for a talent, you'll lose 1 ultra.

This temporal model of talent incentivizes consistent and meaningful practice, as well as allowing you reflect on how far you've came and see how actually following habits benefits your life.

## Why are you making Ultra?
Main objective of this project is to learn and execute the full MERN stack on a cool project idea that I had, which I think may actually enrich my life due to my obsession with mastery! It also acts as a proper mark of a PWA developer by accomplishing such a project.

## Getting Started with Developing Ultra
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Launching with Docker
Command: docker run -v ${PWD}:/app -v /app/node_modules -p 3000:3000 --rm reactapp:v1

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
