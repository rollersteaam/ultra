## Total Project Time
49.28 tracked hours + 6.5 untracked hours = 55.78 = 56.0 hours (rnd. 2sf)

## What is Ultra?
Ultra times how long you practice a talent, allowing you to earn ultra. 1 ultra is the equivalent of 7 consecutive days of 30 minutes practice, or 40 hours of total consistent progress.

Both will progress towards an ultra, so you can put in as much effort as you want and be rewarded for it. 1 ultra represents 1 step of major improvement in a talent. If you don't keep up at minimum 30 minutes of practice, every other day for a talent, you'll lose 1 ultra.

This model of talent incentivizes consistent and meaningful practice, as well as allowing you to reflect on how far you've came and see how practicing and actually following habits benefits your life.

## Why are you making Ultra?
### The Primary Objective
Neuroplasticity and habits are at the heart of people today. Never before has it been more important to develop talents, and frankly, never before have we been more concerned with the process of self-improvement. One could argue that society's push for it is unhealthy.

Either way, people are happy when they recognise they're good at something. The problem is that it takes a while before someone does become good at something. Even worse - becoming good at something is dependent on motivation, consistency, and quality of practice.

Neuroplasticity shows how much potential we have. We can become anything. Habits show the pathway. Ultra aims to combine both into a focus for every day - every ultra earned is a mark of habit and neuroplastic growth. Ultra is a tool that will help you realize your true potential.

### The Secondary Objective
To learn and execute the full MERN stack on a cool project idea that I think will enrich my life! It also acts as a proper mark of a PWA developer by accomplishing such a project.

## Getting Started with Developing Ultra
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Launching with Docker
Build: `$ docker build -t reactapp:v1 .`

Run: `$ docker run -v "${PWD}":/app -v /app/node_modules -p 3000:3000 --rm reactapp:v1`

### Available Scripts

You will need to download and install npm: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
